He went in with purpose.&nbsp;He understood what he had to do: he had to aid the squad in whatever way he could, whether it was with a goal or an assist. He said that he wanted to give his all, and he did.</p><p>Antonio Leao, Leao’s father, said in an interview before the World Cup that he had entire trust in his son. He stated he always advises his kid to give it his all no matter what the coach gives him, whether it’s two minutes, five minutes, or 10 minutes since a good player scores in minutes. As a result, he has trust in his kid and is certain that he will play in Qatar, he continued.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Rafael-Leao-1.jpg alt="Rafael Leao" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Leao is an extremely bashful individual.</h2><p>Off the field, the young potential Leao is the polar opposite. He is a pretty bashful guy. He likes to spend his leisure time napping and relaxing. He spends most of his time inside. He had been bashful since he was a youngster. He enjoyed spending time with his pals, but he didn’t say much and preferred to be alone.</p><h2>He has his national jersey framed.</h2><p>Leao has framed his national jersey at home to display his passion for his country.&nbsp;He describes wearing the jersey as a source of pride for him since he has worked hard to get there.</p><h2>He celebrates his accomplishment with a phone gesture.</h2><p>Leao is seen making a phone call to celebrate his accomplishments. During the Q&A with Max Brigante, he disclosed the source of his celebration.&nbsp;He claims that while he was playing for Sporting CP, they had a few conflicts, following which his father moved to work in Angola and he remained with his mother.&nbsp;Because his father couldn’t see him play on TV when he phoned, he urged him to make the phone motion as though Leao was calling.&nbsp;From then, the party began. When his father is unable to witness his games, he uses this method to dedicate his goal to him.</p><h2>Music is his second interest, after football.</h2><p>Leao’s second interest is music. His love of music stemmed from his father, who was a musician, but football had always been his primary love.&nbsp;When he was lonely, music was always there to keep him company.&nbsp;In an interview with Rolling Stone, he said that he enjoys hip hop and R&B, particularly Migos, Travis Scott, 6ix9ine, Da Baby, and Rody Rich.&nbsp;He went on to state that he enjoys rapping and hopes to become a rapper after finishing his football career, but for now, it’s simply a hobby.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Rafael-Leao-2.jpg alt="Rafael Leao" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>His net worth is projected to be approximately $5 million as of December 2023, but as one of the potential football players, his net worth will surge in the next days.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Football player</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Rafael Leao</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipmp6RmrluuMSapmaZnKF6oq7OrqtmrJiaerG%2Bzp%2BcrKuZpLuiuIyfpqiskpa5rXnPpZiynaJis7O7zGanqKqkqrSiuIynmK2hn6OurXnTnpimZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./youngr-shares-new-captivating-single-titled-love-in-the-room.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Youngr Shares New Captivating Single Titled 'Love In The Room'">&larr;
