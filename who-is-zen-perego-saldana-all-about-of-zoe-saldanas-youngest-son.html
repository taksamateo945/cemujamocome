Zen was born on the 12th of February 2017 and is currently </b><strong>6 </strong><b>years old.&nbsp;</b></p><p>Zen’s birth came as a huge surprise to many, as actress Zoe never posted any pictures of her being pregnant with a new baby. On later announcing this news and displaying pictures of her two years twins alongside, her fans couldn’t contain their joy and became curious to know more about the little champ and everything going on in his life.</p><h3><span>&nbsp;</span><b>Zen Zen Perego-Saldanas Bio</b></h3><ul><li><span><strong>AGE:</strong> 6 Years Old</span></li><li><span><strong>BIRTHDAY:</strong> 12th February 2017</span></li><li><span><strong>BIRTHPLACE:</strong> Los Angeles, California, United States</span></li><li><span><strong>BIRTH SIGN:</strong> Aquarius</span></li><li><span><strong>ETHNICITY:</strong> Multi-ethnic</span></li><li><span><strong>FATHER:</strong> Marco Perego-Saldana</span></li><li><span><strong>MOTHER:</strong> Zoe Perego-Saldana</span></li><li><strong>SIBLINGS:</strong> Twin brothers; Cy Ardio Perego-Saldana and Bowie Perego-Saldana</li></ul><h2><b>How Old is Zen Perego-Saldana Today?</b></h2><p><span>The youngest son of Zoe Saldana, Zen Perego-Saldana, was born on the 12th of February 2017 and is 6 years old now. He was born in Los Angeles, California, to his mother, actress Zoe Saldana and his father Marco Perego. According to his date of birth, Zen’s zodiac sign is Aquarius. She is an American national and is of mixed ethnicity; his mum is Spanish, while his dad is Italian.</span></p><p><span>Zen is multi-lingual because his parents speak Spanish, Italian, and English around him and his siblings. Meanwhile, the actress stated that her children will be addressed as Perego-Saldana bearing both her name and that of her husband. </span><span>Zen has two older brothers who are identical twins; Cy Aridio and Bowie Ezio Perego-Saldana.</span></p><p><span>They were born on the 27th of November 2014 in Los Angeles, California, and are now 9 years old. The twins were born through an emergency cesarian section, and their birth came as a surprise to Zoe’s fans, just as that of Zen. </span><span>Being the younger brother of identical twins, Zen Perego-Saldana didn’t always find it easy growing up with his brothers as they are always together and do almost everything together.</span></p><h2><b>Are Zen Perego’s Parents Still Together?</b></h2><p>Zen’s parents, Zoe Perego-Saldana and Marco Perego got married in 2013 and have remained together ever since then. Their marriage was held in London, United Kingdom. Two years after their wedding, Saldana stated that Perego adopted her surname, and she adopted his too.</p><p>So, while she began to bear Zoë Saldana-Perego, Marco became Marco Perego-Saldana, and their children are Perego-Saldana. As earlier mentioned, Saldaña has said that her children will be multi-lingual because she and her husband speak Spanish, Italian, and English fluently in their presence.</p><p>Though Zoe has decided not to always showcase her kids in most of the events she attends, the actress has shared a few sweet anecdotes about her boys over the years, as seen on her Instagram story. So, her fans have begun to speculate that Zen is going to take his parents’ footsteps in choosing his career, which is not a surprise.</p><p>However, as he is still a child, it is not yet certain about the career path he will choose. Zen will make decisions for himself when he comes of age, and his parents will certainly grant him all the support he needs.</p><h2><b>Perego-Saldana Teaches their Children to Stop Stereotyping</b></h2><p>Zen, his parents, and siblings are living together happily in their home in Los Angeles. Zoe and her husband have always told their kids that both mom and dad could take up a particular task without designating which particular task belongs to either mum or dad. As to this, mom or dad can be role models.</p><p>Zoe stated in an interview that she finds it really ridiculous when some parents say that a particular child is daddy’s girl while the other is mama’s boy. She said that such could be very unhealthy for a child’s development, and that makes it seem that women have just a limited responsibility in the family. The couple is simply raising Zen alongside their other kids the best way they can.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmsKCfYra0edmepWaolaeyqLuMrJilnJGjrm6ty6VkmpqfqsFuu8VmsaidXaiurbDAp5isZamkwq%2BzxKyrZqufo3w%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./david-miller-3.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="David Miller - Net Worth, Age, Height, Birthday, Bio, Wiki!">&larr;
