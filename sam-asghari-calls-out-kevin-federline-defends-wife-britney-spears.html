I’m not saying that I’m not happy for her,’ explains Jayden. ‘I’m really happy for them, but she didn’t invite the whole family and then if it was just going to be me and Preston, I just don’t see how that situation would have ended on good terms.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Following her divorce Britney suffered a well-publicised breakdown that culminated in Kevin gaining custody of their children in 2007. After the conservatorship was established in 2008 Britney acquired shared custody again, and occasional snapshots of Britney with the boys over the years – beaming at the camera at a baseball match, celebrating birthday dinners, splashing around in a swimming pool – suggest a tender bond between mother and sons was forged.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But Kevin was reportedly given 70 per cent custody in 2019.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The children then stopped their over night stays. Their monitors visits became less frequent, until they decided to stop visiting their mom.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In person the boys are bright, articulate and – thanks to Kevin and his wife Victoria’s diligent parenting – pretty much like any other pair of teenagers.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Although younger, Jayden is the more extrovert of the siblings, a self-taught pianist who, like his mother perhaps, views music as ‘therapy’ and speaks on the siblings’ behalf.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Preston, who also enjoys music and art, is more sensitive, and camera shy. The pair enjoy an irrevocable bond borne of their unique upbringing. ‘Preston and I are very united. He is always looking out for me and I am looking out for him. We make sure that we are both healthy mentally,’ says Jayden.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They offer a fascinating insight into an upbringing overshadowed by their mother’s stardom, controversial conservatorship and ongoing concern for her mental health – earlier this year Britney posted a series of naked pictures online to celebrate her freedom, before deleting them.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Recalling growing up with a famous mother, Jayden said:&nbsp;‘There was this TV and it just showed all these people, and it showed her singing and dancing on the stage, and when I saw that I was like ‘Wow, that is a lot of people’ and I came to the realisation of how famous she was and how successful she is as a person and that inspired me.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Her turbulent life in her £10m Los Angeles mansion is in stark contrast to the domestic stability Preston and Jayden enjoy just a few miles away.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>They share a home with their father and his wife Victoria, 39, a former volleyball champion, Kevin’s older children, Kori, 20 and Kaleb, 18, from a previous relationship with actress Shar Jackson, and his two children with Victoria – Jordan, 11 and eight-year-old Peyton. ‘I feel this is my safe place. My home,’ says Jayden. ‘I love everybody here.’</p><img decoding=async id=i-ad7d0dea68c517b4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/09/01/18/61960655-11170247-image-m-35_1662052203710.jpg height=700 width=960 alt="The family allowed filming to take place in the park as part of a documentary in which they opened up on their relationship with Britney Spears" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>The family allowed filming to take place in the park as part of a documentary in which they opened up on their relationship with Britney Spears</p><img decoding=async id=i-7718cdfb4019db78 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/09/02/11/61961199-11172247-Daphne_Barak_middle_interviews_Britney_s_ex_husband_Kevin_Federl-a-14_1662114780007.jpg height=1045 width=959 alt="Daphne Barak (middle) interviews Britney's ex-husband Kevin Federline (right) and son Jayden (left)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>Daphne Barak (middle) interviews Britney’s ex-husband Kevin Federline (right) and son Jayden (left)</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Yet he is keen to stress he also loves the Spears family Britney has relentlessly criticised.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In addition to lashing out at what she describes as an ‘abusive’ conservatorship imposed by her father Jamie, 70, the singer has accused her mother Lynne, 67, who separated from Jamie in 2002, of being the ‘brains’ behind the conservatorship.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She has described her sister Jamie Lynne, 31, as ‘insane’ for not siding with her against her parents and accused her brother Bryan, 45, of treating her like ‘absolutely nothing.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kevin, who met Britney at a Hollywood club in 2004, when she was emerging from a 55-hour long marriage to her childhood friend Jason Alexander and he was expecting his second child with Shar, admits his relationship with Britney’s father has not been without incident.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In November 2019 he took out a restraining order against his former father-in-law Jamie following claims of an altercation. But he believes Jamie ‘really cares about his family’ and the sentiment is one his sons echo, despite having been critical towards him in the past.</p><img decoding=async id=i-35de3626b81100aa src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/09/01/18/61961221-11170247-image-m-64_1662052697662.jpg height=1684 width=962 alt="Britney Spears and Kevin Federline arrive at the 2006 Grammy Nominees party in Hollywood, California" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>Britney Spears and Kevin Federline arrive at the 2006 Grammy Nominees party in Hollywood, California</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Jaden said: ‘At first he was just trying to be like any father letting her pursue her daughter’s dream of becoming a superstar but I did think maybe the conservatorship went on too long, probably why my Mum was very angry about the whole situation that she was working for too long and I personally think she was.&nbsp;She should have taken a break and relaxed.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But he adds that Jamie ‘doesn’t deserve all the hatred he is getting in the media. I love him, with all my heart. He was just trying to be a father.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He says his mother is ‘ceasing to realise how much he cares for her’ and cannot parry the manipulative Spears family Britney has portrayed with the relatives he knows.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘When I meet them in person they would not do such things,’ says Jayden, describing his fun loving Uncle Bryan as someone who ‘always wants to go and play ball in the park’ and his grandmother Lynne, who he calls Memow, ‘a really nice person’.&nbsp;</p><img decoding=async id=i-d9b7274bf1b67e6d src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/09/02/11/61961305-11172247-Britney_Spears_with_father_Jamie_Spears_in_a_photo_she_posted_on-a-13_1662114780006.jpg height=577 width=469 alt="Britney Spears with father Jamie Spears in a photo she posted on Instagram on June 21, 2015, with caption: Happy Father's Day, daddy!

Love you!!’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Whenever I see her, she cares about me. They are not bad people! They know what we are going through now. They want our future to be what we want it to be. They just want to watch over us. Memow and Uncle Bryan are a good part of our lives. They have taught me how to deal with things.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Not that he has always felt this sanguine towards them. In March 2020 Jayden, when questioned by fans on social media, described Jamie as a ‘d**k.’ Now, however, he says: ‘Looking back, I regret saying all kinds of things. I really feel bad. Preston and I feel bad. We want to see him. I want to see him, sit with him next to the piano, talk about my future.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Coming to terms with their mother posting pictures of herself naked online must have been embarrassing enough for the teenagers, but seeing themselves thrust into the public eye against their will is arguably more troubling, especially for Preston, who, Jayden says, ‘doesn’t like the cameras. He asked my mother not to post his photos, and she did it anyway. So it didn’t go well.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He, meanwhile, seems torn between thinking Britney has a right to broadcast her life and body on Instagram and wanting her to realise the ramifications on her family. ‘Social media helps her… So if that’s what she wants to do that’s what she wants to do, I’m not going to hate her for that. At the same time, she should come to the realisation of whatever it is that stops her loving her family.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It’s almost like she has to post something on Instagram to get some attention. This has gone on for years and years and years and there’s a high chance that this will never stop but I’m hoping for me that she will stop.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Perhaps wisely, neither boy is consumed by social media. ‘I do have an Instagram account but I barely go on it,’ says Jayden, while Preston, he adds, is prone to ‘overthinking’ about what strangers will say about him. Instead, home ‘is our safe place to process all the emotional trauma we have been through to actually heal.
