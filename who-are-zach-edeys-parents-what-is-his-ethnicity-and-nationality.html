This has made Zach, who was born in Toronto, a Chinese-Canadian national and of Asian ethnicity.</strong></p><p>Julia and Glen have refused to open up about their personal lives and career endeavors, but their son is a known collegiate basketball player in the Big Ten Conference. He currently plays with the team Purdue Boilermakers.</p><h2><strong>A Look&nbsp; At Zach Edey’s Parents and </strong><strong>Family Background</strong></h2><p>From what is perceivable, Zach Edey falls under the category of celebs that are averse to bringing the details of their early life and family background to the public arena. However, fans and the general public keep getting tidbits from time to time.</p><p>It came to the fore that the Big Ten Conference player’s parents are Glen Edey (father) and his wife, Julia Edey. They welcomed Zach Edey on the 14th of May 2002, and the basketballer’s place of birth is captured by the records as Toronto, Ontario in Canada, where he also spent a better part of his growing up years.</p><p>As earlier mentioned, the detailed history of his lineage has remained under the shade since Zach burst onto the limelight. However, the fillers we are getting say the Edey family are most likely Chinese immigrants who decided to put down roots in Canada.</p><p>Zach is not the only child of his parents; he was brought up alongside a younger brother named Dough Edey. Dough is also athletic like his big brother, and he has been representing his school Leaside High School in athletics.</p><h3><strong>Who is Zach Edey’s Mother?</strong></h3><p>The player for the team of Purdue Boilermakers has not revealed much about his mother, but she is known as Julia Edey. Since Julia is no celebrity, it is difficult to get information about her early life and family background. However, the mother of the 7 feet 4 inches basketball player is said to carry some Asian heritage in her gene pool.</p><p>Besides, anybody who has seen Julia’s picture is sure to believe Zach Edey’s mother is connected to the Asian continent, as her looks say it all. Though she is someone who loves to live her life well away from the prying eyes of the media and the general public, Julia still manages to establish a presence on social media platforms; she is especially visible on Instagram.</p><p>On the picture-sharing platform, Zach Edey’s mother’s handle is @beejules21. However, this particular account is private; thus, the public has no access to her images and videos. So far, Julia has recorded 146 followers on her IG handle and still counting, and the number of posts shared on her account came to a total of 67 at the last count.</p><p>Julia’s Instagram handle contrasts greatly with that of her son, whose IG handle – @zach_edey, has amassed above 14.7k followers. Zack Edey’s IG page is a verified one where the giant basketball player shares stuff about his day-to-day life, including details about his basketball career.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Proud to announce my commitment to Purdue <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">#BoilerUp</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/54EqhXRJCR</a></p><p>— zach (@zach_edey) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">November 9, 2019</a></p><h3><strong>Who Is Zach Edey’s Father?</strong></h3><p>While very little is known about Zach Edey’s mother from the titbits her son shares on the internet space, absolutely nothing has been said about the patriarch of the Edey family – Glen Edey. Considering this, info about his birth family, birth details, and profession are still under the shade, but he goes by the name Glen Edey.</p><p>Unlike Julia, whose image has been severally spotted on the internet space, Glen seems to have shunned publicity as his image has never been seen anywhere on social media. Glen’s refusal to surface in public has made it difficult for fans of the giant basketball player to unravel the mystery of the source of his imposing height.</p><p>However, considering the fact that he could not have gotten it from his mum, Julia, who is obviously below average height, it has been concluded that his dad is responsible for his exceptional tallness.</p><h2><strong>When Did Zach Edey’s Parents Get Married?</strong></h2><p>Being people that love to keep their personal lives under wraps, Glen and Julia’s relationship history has continued to elude the media. Information on when they met, how long they dated, and when they tied the connubial knot is not available for public consumption.</p><p>With that said, when you consider the age of the son Zach Edey who just hit his 20s, it becomes glaring that the duo has been an item for at least two decades. The Edey family is said to be a close-knit one, supporting each other in their different life endeavors.</p><h3><strong>Zach Edey’s Relationship with Both Parents</strong></h3><p>According to reports, the parents of Zach Edey have always stood by their son in his basketball career. The Big Ten Conference player says he enjoys his parents’ steadfast support, which has gone a long way in shaping him into the excellent player he has become today.</p><p>Reports said both parents are always on hand to cheer their son on the field of play. It is quite difficult to say who Zach is closer to among his parents, but since he has only ever been photographed with his mom, guesses ate that the mother-son bond may be greater.</p><h2><strong>What is Zach Edey’s </strong><strong>Nationality and Ethnicity?</strong></h2><p>Considering his birth details above, Zach Edey is of Canadian nationality and is from Asian ethnic background.&nbsp;Internet sources listed the giant player as a man of Chinese-Canadian roots, which rings true since his parents have been revealed to have come from the Asian continent.</p><p>Apart from the account of online sources, Zach Edey’s facial appearance is a testament to his Asian roots. From his hair to skin color and other facial features.</p><p>With that said, we must also note that his great height of 7 feet 4 inches is somewhat uncommon in the Asian continent, especially in China, where their men don’t grow past the average height of 5 feet 7.6 inches, which is the equivalent of 171.8 cm.</p><p>Besides, since the basketball player’s mum has been severally sited in his company and she conforms to the average height of the Chinese, there is the possibility that Zach Edey has an undisclosed extra in his ethnicity mix, perhaps from the father’s side.</p><h2><strong>Key Facts About Zach Edey’s Parents, Ethnicity and Nationality</strong></h2><p><strong>Who are Zach Edey’s parents?</strong></p><p>Zach Edey was born to Julia and Glen Edey. His mother, Julia, of Chinese heritage, has a visible presence in his collegiate basketball career, attending most Purdue games and sometimes distributing t-shirts with his nickname, “The Big Maple”, to supporters. Glen Edey, Zach’s father, is of Caucasian descent.

His mother, Julia, is of Chinese heritage, and his father, Glen, is Caucasian. This blend of cultures contributes to his unique heritage.</p><p><strong>What is Zach Edey’s height and how does it influence his game?</strong></p><p>Standing at 7ft 4in (2.24 meters), Zach Edey is the tallest player in Big Ten history.
