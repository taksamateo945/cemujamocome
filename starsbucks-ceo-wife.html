She is also the chairman and co-founder of the Schultz Family Foundation.</p><p>She has dedicated her life to using social entrepreneurship to change the world, working alongside her husband Howard Schultz, a well-known former CEO of Starbucks.</p><p>Sheri has assisted in the development and implementation of various initiatives to support veterans, empower kids, and advance social justice in her role as chair of the Schultz Family Foundation.</p><p>The goal of the Schultz family foundation, which Sheri and her husband Howard Schultz founded in 1996, was to remove barriers from young people’s and their families’ paths to success.</p><p>Under Sheri’s leadership as Chair, the foundation has developed and financed cutting-edge initiatives to promote services for <a href=#>mental health</a>, job training, and education.</p><p>One of the most well-known foundation programmes, Onward Veteran, helps veterans make the transition from the military to civilian life by providing them with opportunities for education, employment, and entrepreneurship.</p><p>Sheri is regarded as one of the most prosperous businesswomen, having developed a number of successful companies throughout the course of her career and charity initiatives.</p><p>With her writing and public speaking, she has shared her knowledge and viewpoints.</p><h3>Sheri Starbucks career</h3><p>Sheri Schultz, the wife of Howard Schultz, began her legal career by working for the Legal Aid Foundation of Chicago and the Children’s Defense Fund, where she solely focused on issues impacting children and families.</p><p>After the pair established the foundation, Sheri oversaw the distribution of millions of dollars in grants to groups that aid veterans and children in obtaining job training, educational opportunities, and a host of other services.</p><p>In addition to her work with the Schultz Family Foundation, Sheri serves on a number of organisations, including the Board of Trustees for the Aspen Institute and the Board of Directors for the University of Michigan Law School.</p><p>She is also a member of the advisory board for the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p><p>Sheri’s work has been characterised by her commitment to social justice and desire to make people’s lives better. Her efforts had an impact on the lives of many individuals and families, and her influence will be felt for many years to come.</p><h3>The married life of Starbucks and Sheri Schultz</h3><p>Howard Schultz, the CEO of Starbucks, has been married to Sheri Schultz for over 40 years, and they still cherish their union.</p><p>While Sheri was a cheerleader and Howard was a college football player at Northern Michigan University, the couple first got together.</p><p>They have each other’s support and have been dedicated to changing the world since getting married in 1982.</p><p>Throughout their marriage, Howard and Sheri have worked together on numerous charity endeavours, including forming the Schultz Family Foundation.</p><p>As the former CEO of Starbucks, Sheri had a big role in Howard’s success. They have also been supportive of one another’s career goals and personal interests.</p><p>About the importance of her effect on Howard’s life and leadership, Sheri has been referred to as his “partner in everything” in public speeches.</p><h3>Husband of Sheri Schlutz</h3><p>Howard Schultz, Sheri Schlutz’s husband, is a 68-year-old novelist and businessman. His commercial experience greatly contributed to his increasing income as he built a successful profession for himself and amassed a net worth of $4 million.</p><p>He is credited with founding Starbucks even though Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker established the company in 1971 at Seattle’s Pike Place Market.</p><p>Until then, Starbucks was just a businessman selling coffee beans, but after Schultz bought it in the early 1980s, it grew into a fully functional cafe. He decided to entirely convert the store into an espresso-based drinks cafe.</p><p>Starbucks was largely responsible for the businessman’s billion-dollar earnings. Throughout the period from 1986 and 2000, he served as CEO.</p><p>He grabbed it back during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Under Schultz’s leadership, Starbucks expanded into a global brand with over 34,300 locations.</p><h3>Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz’s wife’s net worth</h3><p>The estimated net worth of Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is $4.3 billion, but Sheri’s wealth hasn’t been made public yet.</p><p>Sheri may profit monetarily by Howard Schultz’s wealth, but the general public is unaware of her considerable worth.</p><h3>House of Starbucks and Schultz</h3><p>Starbucks CEO and billionaire Howard Schultz recently completed the purchase of an eight-bedroom, $25 million property in Hawaii’s Hualalai resort area.</p><p>10,641 square feet are used for living space in the new house, Schultz. On Hualalai, there are two golf courses, a lot of sports clubs, beach clubs, and swimming areas.</p><p>Kukio, Hawaii’s most affluent neighbourhood, where Michael Dell’s 18,500-square-foot Raptor Mansion is located on prime property, is its nearest neighbour to the south.</p><p>According to Clarke, the house was “essentially the best option for a house on Hualalai right now.” It was the largest piece of real estate currently for sale in the resort.</p><p>Schultz’s new home, which has views of lava rock, coconut trees, and mountains, is set back from the Pacific Ocean on the resort’s golf course.</p><p>Nine baths, a Jacuzzi, a video room, a game room, a media room, a Jacuzzi, and an infinity edge pool are all included.</p><p>The house is spread out over two lots, one of which has the main house and the other four separate pods. Teak is used to cover the walls of the house.</p><h3>Howard Schultz’s Yacht</h3><p>Every luxury imaginable may be found on Howard Schultz’s $145 million yacht. Hacht is the pinnacle of elegance and luxury.</p><p>Howard Schultz serves as the CEO of the massive Starbucks coffee shop network. More than 30000 Starbucks shops may be found in 77 different countries, despite the company starting as a single coffee shop in Seattle.</p><p>Due to this big company, Howard Schultz has amassed a sizable net worth of approximately $4 billion. He paid a staggering $145 Million in 2019 for the opulent boat Pi.</p><p>Yachts can be categorised as extravagant, cutting-edge, or magnificent. Yet, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz’s $145 million super yacht Pi has also been labelled “auspicious.” Pi is the height of magnificence and beauty.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt="howard schultz age,starbucks owner tata,starbucks owner in india,howard schultz family,howard schultz house,howard schultz kids,howard schultz net worth,howard schultz yacht,starbucks ceo wife,current ceo of starbucks,starbucks ceo net worth,starbucks ceo phone number,starbucks coffee ceo" itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
