There’s the always-polarizing&nbsp;<a href=#>Jackson and Brittany Mahomes</a>&nbsp;and the star of Super Bowl week (and&nbsp;<a href=#>mother of the Kelce brothers</a>), Donna Kelce. Even the owners are relatively well-known.&nbsp;<a href=#>Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie</a>&nbsp;is new-school but looking for his second Lombardi trophy in five years, while&nbsp;<a href=#>Chiefs’ owner</a>&nbsp;Clark Hunt is old school, the son of the legendary Lamar Hunt, the man who literally invented the term “Super Bowl.” Despite all these familiar faces in the stands (OK, luxury boxes), the most fascinating person up there may be the daughter of the Chiefs owner, Gracie Hunt. So, the question is, who is Gracie Hunt?</p><h2 id=h-who-is-the-chiefs-owner-s-daughter-gracie-hunt><span id=who-is-the-chiefs-owners-daughter-gracie-hunt><strong>Who is the Chiefs owner’s daughter Gracie Hunt?</strong></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Gracie Hunt is the 23-year-old daughter of Chiefs owner Clark Hunt and his wife, Tavia.</p><p>She is also a model, an influencer, a philanthropist, a former soccer player, a marathon runner, Miss Kansas USA 2021, and, as you’d guess, a huge Chiefs fan.</p><p>Gracie Hunt was a soccer star in high school, helping her team to state championships and earning a spot on the SMU college squad. However, four concussions ended her career before she could get to the next level. As her soccer dreams died, Gracie decided to follow in her mother’s footsteps.</p><p>Tavia Hunt (née Shackles) was a former Miss Missouri Teen USA and Miss Kansas USA in the late 1990s. In 2021, 28 years after Tavia took home the crown and sash, Gracie won Miss Kansas USA. Later that year, she made it to the semifinals of the 2021 Miss USA competition.</p><p>Today, Gracie Hunt is busier than ever. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her website</a>, she works in PR for the Chiefs and is a brand ambassador for the NFL. She is also pursuing a Master’s degree in sports management at the University of Kansas.</p><p>Meanwhile, she also volunteers her time as a Unified Champion Ambassador for Special Olympics and at her own foundation, Breaking Barriers Through Sports, which “promotes respect and inclusion worldwide.”</p><p>The daughter of the Chiefs owner has also amassed over 269,000 Instagram followers and graced the cover of Maxim magazine leading up to the Super Bowl.</p><p>So, who is Graice Hunt? She is a pretty impressive person for a 23-year-old, but just about what you’d expect from the granddaughter of the man who invented the Super Bowl.</p><h2 id=the-next-generation-of-nfl-owners><strong>The next generation of NFL owners</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sportscasting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Who-is-Gracie-Hunt-1.jpg><p>Gracie Hunt isn’t the only fascinating daughter or granddaughter of an NFL owner these days. More and more NFC scions are stepping into the spotlight in 2023 as this generation of owners get older.</p><p>Some owners’ children are well known for helping run the team as their parents get older. Stephen Jones (son of Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones) and Jonathan Kraft (son of New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft) both fit this bill.</p><p>Tony Khan also helps his dad, Shad Khan, in the front office of the Jacksonville Jaguars (and Fulham FC in the Premier League). However, he is best known as <a href=#>the owner and driving creative force</a> behind All Elite Wrestling (AEW), the biggest competitor to the WWE in two decades.</p><p>Jessica Pegula, daughter of Buffalo Bills owners Terry and Kim Pegula, will someday follow in her mother’s footsteps and run the Bills and Sabres. That’s on hold for now, though, as she is the No. 4-ranked women’s tennis player in the world right now, according to the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WTA</a>.</p><p>Last but not least, there is Kate and Rooney Mara. Both are actors of note, with Kate starring in well-known shows like&nbsp;House of Cards&nbsp;and Rooney playing the lead in the blockbuster movie,&nbsp;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.</p><p>These sisters win the award for most NFL owner-y offspring of all the NFL owner offspring, and Rooney Mara’s name tells you why.</p><p>Mara obviously comes from her father, Tim, who works for the New York Giants, a team currently owned by his brother, John. Her first name comes from her mother’s side of the family. Kathleen McNulty Mara’s (née&nbsp;Rooney) grandfather, Art Rooney, founded the Pittsburgh Steelers. Kate and Rooney’s first cousin, once removed, Art Rooney II, owns the team today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9Kppquso2TEqbuMoqpmn6KWsKqxjKGsp6xdqbWmecOarKCgpJq%2FbrvFZquhnV2grq%2B%2FwKxknKGkrnqktMienaxln6y7pr6O</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./fleecy-female-in-a-flock-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fleecy female in a flock">&larr;
